# Nmap - Network Scanning  
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool for scanning open ports, identifying running services, and fingerprinting operating systems.  

## ðŸ”¹ How I Used Nmap  
During my penetration test on testphp.vulnweb.com, I ran:  

'''bash
nmap -sV -O testphp.vulnweb.com

âœ… Findings:
	â€¢	Port 80 (HTTP) was open, running Apache/2.4.18
	â€¢	No other critical ports were found

ðŸ”¹ Useful Nmap Commands
	â€¢	nmap -p- testphp.vulnweb.com â†’ Scan all ports
	â€¢	nmap -A testphp.vulnweb.com â†’ Enable OS and version detection

ðŸ”¹ Mitigation Strategy

To prevent unauthorized scanning, websites should:
âœ… Implement firewall rules to restrict access
âœ… Use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect port scanning.
