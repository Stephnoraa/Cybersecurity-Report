# Wireshark - Network Traffic Analysis  
Wireshark is a packet analysis tool used to capture and inspect network traffic.  

## ðŸ”¹ How I Used Wireshark  
- Captured *HTTP POST requests* during login attempts  
- Extracted *username/password* from unencrypted traffic  

## ðŸ”¹ Useful Wireshark Filters  
- http.request.method == "POST" â†’ Capture login credentials  
- tcp.port == 80 â†’ Capture HTTP traffic  
- frame contains "password" â†’ Find passwords in packets  

## ðŸ”¹ Mitigation Strategy  
âœ… Websites should *encrypt sensitive data* with HTTPS  
âœ… Implement *secure authentication methods*
